# weatherUndergroundParsing

I tried to scrape weather data from Weather Underground and found two deprecated scripts online.
It seems like WU changes their setup every now and then so I had to change a couple of things to make them work again.

# Installation

> pip3 install beautifulsoup4

# How to run this

- Change the setting in config.py
- Run the individual scripts as for example:
> python wunderground_hourly_data_from_airport.py
